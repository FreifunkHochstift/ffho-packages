ffho-ath9k-blackout-workaround
==============================

In order to avoid further WiFi-Blackouts that *might* be caused by buggy ath9k,
we try to detect problems and restart the wifi.

**ath9k_workaround.blackout_wait:**
- minimum delay in minutes to detect a possible blackout as blackout

  ...
},
